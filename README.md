## About Stepper

Stepper is a tool to save sequence of commands for repetitive tasks. Let me break down this for a bit. Imagine you, frequently, do sequence of commands to accomplish a mission. Example, Configuring Ubuntu Server. While you are not a "Linux Master" and you forget those commands eventually. Stepper is here to save your missions (sequence of commands) to copy/paste them when needed. This idea encouraged me to create the Stepper.
